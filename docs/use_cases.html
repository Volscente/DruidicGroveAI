    <h3>Business Case</h3>
    <p>
      <b> Goal: </b> automatically categorize answers on Stack Overflow as "High Quality,"
      "Medium Quality," or "Low Quality."
    </p>
    <h3>Impacts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Improving User Experience and Retention</strong> - High-quality answers enhance user satisfaction by quickly providing accurate and helpful solutions. Automatically classifying answer quality can enable better curation, ensuring users see the most relevant and reliable responses first. This leads to increased trust and engagement with the platform.</li>
      <li><strong>Enhancing Community Moderation Efficiency</strong> - Moderators often face an overwhelming number of posts to review. Automating answer quality classification can act as a triage tool, flagging low-quality answers for moderation or prioritizing high-quality ones for promotion. This reduces manual effort and allows moderation resources to be allocated more effectively.</li>
      <li><strong>Boosting Advertising and Monetization Opportunities</strong> - Platforms with high-quality, well-organized content are more attractive to advertisers. By highlighting and prioritizing high-quality answers, the platform can maintain a professional image, attracting premium advertisers and partners while potentially increasing ad click-through rates.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Metrics</h3>
    <h4>North Star Metric</h4>
    <ul>
